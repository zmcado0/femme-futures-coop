**A beautiful, beginner-friendly newsletter website that works with GitHub Pages!**

---

## 🚀 **5-Minute Setup (No Coding Required!)**

### Step 1: Get This Website Online

1. **Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)** and create a free account
2. **Click "New Repository"** (the green button)
3. **Name your repository** (like `my-newsletter-site`)
4. **Make it Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. **Click "Create Repository"**

### Step 2: Upload Your Website

1. **Click "uploading an existing file"**
2. **Drag and drop ALL the files** from this folder onto the page
3. **Write a message** like "Initial website upload"
4. **Click "Commit changes"**

### Step 3: Make It Live

1. **Go to Settings** (tab at the top of your repository)
2. **Scroll down to "Pages"** section
3. **Select "Deploy from a branch"**
4. **Choose "main"** branch and **"/ (root)"** folder
5. **Click "Save"**

**🎉 Your website is now live at:** `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

_(It takes 5-10 minutes to go live the first time)_

### Step 4: Understand Your GitHub Repository Structure

After uploading, your GitHub repository should look like this:

```
📂 your-repository-name/
├── 📄 index.html
├── 🎨 styles.css
├── ⚙️ script.js
├── 📊 newsletters.json
├── 📁 Newsletters/
│   ├── Let's Talk AI.docx
│   ├── 25 Things I Believe About Myself.docx
│   ├── ✨Bonus✨ Help Wanted.docx
│   └── ✨Bonus✨ It's Been a Year.docx
├── 📖 README.md
└── 📄 LICENSE
```

### What Each File Does:

- **📄 index.html** - Your main website page (customize the text here)
- **🎨 styles.css** - Controls colors, fonts, and design  
- **⚙️ script.js** - Makes the website work (don't need to edit this)
- **📊 newsletters.json** - List of your newsletter files (update when you add new ones)
- **📁 Newsletters/** - PUT YOUR .DOCX FILES HERE! This is the most important folder
  - Contains all your newsletter files
  - Only .docx files work (not .doc or .pdf)
  - Each file becomes a post on your website
- **📖 README.md** - This instruction guide
- **📄 LICENSE** - Legal permissions for your code

**Important:** The `Newsletters` folder is where you'll add all your newsletter files. Each time you add a new `.docx` file here, you need to update the `newsletters.json` file so your website knows about it.

## 📝 **Adding Your Newsletters**

**The simple way - no coding required!**

   }
   ```

5. **Your website updates automatically!** ✨

## 🎨 **Customizing Your Website**

### Change Your Website Title and Description

**Edit `index.html`** and look for these lines:

```html
<!-- 📝 CHANGE THIS: Your main website title -->
<h1 class="main-title">Femme Futures Cooperative</h1>
<!-- 📝 CHANGE THIS: Your subtitle/description -->
<p class="subtitle">Building community and economic power for women</p>
```

### Update the About Section

**Find this section in `index.html`** (around line 92):

```html
<!-- 📝 ABOUT SECTION - CUSTOMIZE THIS! -->
<h3 class="sidebar-title">About Femme Futures Cooperative</h3>
<p class="sidebar-text">
  Building a cooperative economy where women support each other's success...
</p>
```

### Add Your Support/Donation Link

**Find line 137 in `index.html`** and replace the `#` with your actual link:

```html
<a href="https://your-donation-link-here.com" class="coffee-btn"></a>
```

### Change the Colors (Purple Theme)

**Open `styles.css`** and search for these colors to replace them:

- `#8b5cf6` = Main purple
- `#7c3aed` = Darker purple
- `#a855f7` = Lighter purple

**Example:** To change to blue, replace `#8b5cf6` with `#3b82f6`
